# Perceived Lightness of Faces - Experiment 0 (LF0)
This is the first in a series of experiments. It was written for Matlab's Pscyhophysics Toolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/). 

In this experiment, participants view several faces, one and a time, and must judge whether they are racially black or white ('b' for black, 'w' for white). There are only actually 2 different faces &ndash; the prototypical African-American face and the prototypical Caucausian face used in Levin & Banaji's (2006) original experiment. However, each face has been duplicated several times, with each duplicate made either darker or lighter in luminance than the original (see /stimuli for details). Odd-numbered participants see the faces upright and even-numbered participants see them inverted.
