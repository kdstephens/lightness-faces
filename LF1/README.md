# Experiment LF1
In this experiment, participants view two faces at a time and attempt to match their perceived lightness. This is a replication/extension of Experiment 1 in [Levin & Banaji (2006)](lev2006). (see p. 504 for their description of the experimental procedure). Thus the face stimuli come directly from Levin & Banaji. They consist of three faces &ndash; one pre-rated as racially Black, one pre-rated as racially White, and one pre-rated as racially Ambiguous (i.e., when asked, half of participants rate it as Black and the other half as White). 

On each trial the experiment participants view two faces, one labeled the "reference face" and one labeled the "adjustable face." The participants' task is to manipulate the adjustable face so that its "shading" matches that of the reference face as closely as possible. Adjustments are made using the up-arrow key and down-arrow key. Hitting either key once exchanges the current adjustable face with the same face that is either 5 grey-levels lighter or 5 grey-levels darker. 
 
The experiment has two within-subjects factors (race of reference face vs. race of adjustable face) with three levels each (white, black, or ambiguous), giving 9 total conditions for each participant (i.e., factorial design). There are also two two-level between subjects factors: 
Orientation (upright vs. inverted) and Adjustment screen-side(right vs. left).

On each trial, the reference face is set at one of  five different luminance levels (-10, -5, +5, 0, +10). The initial luminance of the adjustable face is offset from the reference face by +/-2 or +/-4 levels (in increments of 5). Therefore, within each of the 9 conditions, there are 20
trials (for a total of 180 trials per participant).
