# Perceived Lightness of Faces - Experiment MLF0
In this experiment, participants view several faces one at a time and, for each face, participants 
must categorize it as Caucasian (by pressing “c” on the keyboard) or as African-American (by pressing “a” on the keyboard). Participants are  informed that some of the faces might look ambiguous or multi-racial, but they should choose the race that the face looks most like. After choosing a racial category, participants press the return key to submit their response. Each submission is followed by a 500ms interstimulus interval containing a 375 (vertical) by 300 (horizontal) pixel rectangle of Gaussian noise. All faces are shown against a white background at central fixation.

This is similar to experiment *LF0*, except it uses different faces. The faces used in this experiment are a set of "morphed" faces, created by morphing a Caucasian face with an African-American face using the face-morphing software FantaMorph ([fantamorph.com](https://www.fantamorph.com/)). There are two versions of each face morph, one with the hairstyle of the Caucasian face and one with the hairstyle of the African-American face. The original faces come from the database of [Meissner, Brigham, and Butz (2005)](#meis2005). 

The goal of this experiment was to create a set of racially ambiguous faces that participants perceive as Caucasian when wearing one hairstyle but as African-American when wearing another hairstyle.
