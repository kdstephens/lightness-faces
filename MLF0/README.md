# Perceived Lightness of Faces - Experiment MLF0
In this experiment, participants view several faces, one at a time, and must answer one of two questions:
1. Does this face look Caucasian? Or 
2. Does this face look African-American?

In either case, they push 'y' for yes and 'n' for no. 

This is similar to experiment *LF0*, except it uses different faces. The faces used in this experiment are a set of "morphed" faces, created by morphing a Caucasian face with an African-American face. There are two versions of each face morph, one with the hairstyle of the Caucasian face, one with the hairstyle of the African-American face. 

The goal of this experiment was to create a set of racially ambiguous faces that participants perceive as Caucasian when wearing one hairstyle but as African-American when wearing another hairstyle. For more details, see Experiment 3.2a in Chapter 3 of [Stephens, 2015](#step2015) and [MacLin & MacLin (2011)](#maclin2011)
